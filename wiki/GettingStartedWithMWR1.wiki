Basic instructions for the Minimal Working Release #1 of Jungleauth.

MWR1 includes a perl library (Net::Canopy::BAM) for parsing and identifying BAM packets. It also includes a very basic BAM server, csvserver.pl. 

csvserver.pl uses a csv file as the SM database. Example CSV file:

0a003e90e6f8,768,768,768,768
}}}
